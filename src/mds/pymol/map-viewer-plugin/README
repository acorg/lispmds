NOTE: It is no longer necessary to install map-viewer.py as a plugin in
Pymol. You may still choose to do this to access its functionality from the
Plugin menu. The preferred method for using this code is via the lisp
interface. If you are planning on using the lisp interface, the following
instructions are irrelevant to you.


INSTALLATION
------------

WINDOWS:

  Start Pymol and choose Plugin / Install Plugin. Then select the
  map-viewer.py file.

  After that you should see 'Antigenic map' and 'Antibody Landscape' in
  your Plugin menu. If you select 'Antigenic map', it will ask you to
  select a single map file to display. You then choose a .pml data file
  (created by lisp) and it should display. If you select 'Antibody
  Landscape', you will be asked repeatedly to select files for display.
  When you hit Cancel on a file selector, the previously selected files
  will all be displayed. Note that there is currently no way to select an
  options file (though this could be added easily). To do that, use the
  lisp interface instead.

MAC OS X (Aqua/X11 hybrid version of pymol):

  Follow the instructions for installation & use under Windows.

MAC OS X (Aqua version of pymol):

  On the Mac aqua version of Pymol, plugins are not supported. You need to
  type two commands to view a map. Once you have pymol running, type the
  following in the little console window, hitting return after each line

    run /path/to/your/map-viewer.py
    abl optionsFile=None, /path/to/your/saved/file.pml

  and the map should come up. You can then use abl repeatedly to display
  othe maps. I.e., the 'run' command, which loads map-viewer.py and
  provides the abl command, only needs to be entered once per pymol
  session.

INVOKING PROGRAMMATICALLY (e.g., from lisp)

  Run pymol from the command line, and use two -d arguments: one to run the
  map-viewer.py file (which just creates the new abl command), and the
  second to call abl on your map file(s). So on a mac you'd do something
  like

    /Applications/MacPyMOL.app/Contents/MacOS/PyMOL \
      -d 'run /Users/terry/mds/src/mds/pymol/map-viewer-plugin/map-viewer.py' \
      -d 'abl optionsFile=None, /Users/terry/mds/src/mds/pymol/map-viewer-plugin/ron-files/human-3d-2d.pml'

  And on windows you'd probably be invoking

    C:\Program Files\DeLano Scientific\PyMOL\PyMOL.exe

  with similar -d arguments. Note that you can specify an options file if
  you choose.


COMPATIBILITY:

  The map viewer Pymol plugin expects to be given files in a certain python
  form (which it execs). Although these files can be written by hand, it is
  simplest to produce them (and load them into pymol) using lisp.
